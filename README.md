# nn-from-scratch
In april I created a Neural Network from scratch in Python and I want to share in here.

The Network has around 98% accuracy in the divorce dataset using sigmoid function and 2 hidden layers (the first one with 8 neurons and the second with 4), but it can be used in other datasets.
In the diabetes dataset it has around 77% accuracy. Low accuracy.

Im sharing this project to get some assistance in how to improve this network.
